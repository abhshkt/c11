# c11

**c11** is a native macOS terminal multiplexer for the operator:agent pair. One operator runs many agents in parallel; c11 gives every terminal, browser, and markdown surface a handle so the whole field stays legible. Hierarchy: **window → workspace (a sidebar tab) → pane (a split region) → surface (a terminal, browser, or markdown viewer)**.

This card is deliberately short. It covers **orientation** — the one thing every agent does on launch — and a **map** of everything else. Load the named reference when you reach for a capability; don't pull in depth you don't need.

## Detect c11

`C11_SHELL_INTEGRATION=1` means you're inside c11 — prefer native workflows (splits, the embedded browser, `c11 set-metadata`) over Chrome MCP or plain `open`. Other env vars available to child processes: `C11_WORKSPACE_ID`, `C11_SURFACE_ID`, `C11_TAB_ID`, `C11_SOCKET_PATH`. The spawn path may also pre-seed `C11_AGENT_TYPE`, `C11_AGENT_MODEL`, `C11_AGENT_TASK`.

Refs accept UUIDs, short refs, or indexes: `workspace:1`, `pane:2`, `surface:3`, `tab:1`.

**Where new work goes:** a new **pane** when the work wants its own spatial slot (a sub-agent, a log tail, a browser for validation); a new **surface** when a pane just wants another tab; a new **workspace** when the operator names a different project or mission. Default to one workspace per project unless the operator's setup says otherwise.

## Boot fast, orient lazily

c11 stamps your launch identity itself: the sidebar chip (agent type from process detection, plus the pinned model) and a placeholder **"Awaiting first task"** title are set the moment you launch, with no action from you. There is nothing you must run just to be identified — don't spend the operator's time on a mechanical identity ritual.

**You'll usually load this skill because a task arrived** that touches the workspace (a split, a status report, a browser check). When that happens, orient in place and keep moving — at minimal effort, no per-command deliberation:

- Refine the placeholder into your real role: `c11 rename-tab --surface "$C11_SURFACE_ID" "<2–4 word role>"`. The sidebar is the operator's only view into a room of parallel agents, so a working agent must not sit under "Awaiting first task".
- Say why it's open right now: `c11 set-description --surface "$C11_SURFACE_ID" "<current context>"`.
- If your model chip is blank (an unpinned launch c11 couldn't label), set it: `c11 set-agent --surface "$C11_SURFACE_ID" --type "$C11_AGENT_TYPE" --model "$C11_AGENT_MODEL"` — substitute your own known type/model if those vars are empty.
- Reach for `c11 tree` / `c11 identify --json` only when you actually need layout or your refs (footgun below).
- Read a reference (map below) only for the capability you're using — not preemptively.
- **Declare a stable mailbox address** if peers will reach you: `c11 set-metadata --surface "$C11_SURFACE_ID" --key mailbox.address --value "<stable-handle>" --type string`. Titles are mutable and renames silently re-partition the bus; a declared address survives them. (Depth → [docs/c11-mailbox-guide.md](../../docs/c11-mailbox-guide.md).)

**Launched with only a hydrate message and no task yet?** An operator can configure a "load the skill" launch prompt, so your first turn may carry no real task. Don't invent a title — leave the placeholder, reply in one line that you're ready, and set your real title/description from the next real message, as your first action that turn.

> **Pass `--surface` explicitly on surface- or tab-scoped writes.** Every surface exports `$C11_SURFACE_ID` (inherited by subprocesses), so `--surface "$C11_SURFACE_ID"` targets you correctly. As of C11-165 a surface-scoped write with a **missing or empty** ref no longer silently falls back to the operator-focused surface — it is **rejected** with a clear error (`missing_ref` / `empty_ref`), so an omitted or empty flag fails loudly instead of stomping a peer agent's tab. You must therefore still pass a valid ref: if `$C11_SURFACE_ID` reads empty, capture your refs once from `c11 identify --json` and pass the literal `surface:<n>` (robust on any build). Applies to every surface/tab write (`set-metadata`, `set-agent`, `set-title`, `set-description`, `rename-tab`, `clear-metadata`, `trigger-flash`) and to the tab-scoped sidebar writes (`set-status`, `set-progress`, `log`), which require `--workspace`/`--tab` (auto-supplied from `$C11_WORKSPACE_ID` inside a pane; a ref-less call from a bare shell or cron is now rejected rather than routed to the selected tab). Verify the first write with `c11 get-titlebar-state --surface <surface>` against the surface marked `◀ here` in `c11 tree --no-layout`.

### Title vs description, and lineage

- **Title = what the surface *is*** — generic, reusable. A filename for file-backed surfaces (`PHILOSOPHY.md`); a role for terminals (`Phase 2 agent`, `Log tail`).
- **Description = why it's open *right now*** — one or two sentences of current context the operator can read without opening the surface.
- **Refresh both when scope shifts** (plan → impl, ticket → ticket, file → file) — at the pivot, not at session end.
- **Lineage for downstream panes:** chain parent → child with `::` in the title (`Login Button :: MA Review :: Claude`) and lead the description with a `Lineage:` breadcrumb. **Sibling** workers the operator drives directly are *not* downstream — use plain anchors (`Feature Left`, `Lattice Manager`), no chain. Before renaming, check `c11 get-titlebar-state`; if a chain exists, preserve the prefix and refine only the trailing segment.

## What c11 can do — load the reference when you need it

| You want to… | Load |
|---|---|
| split / create / resize panes & surfaces, `tree`, `send`, `read-screen`, targeting, `--cwd` | [references/api.md](references/api.md) |
| launch sub-agents, the tab-naming convention, layout patterns, write c11-aware prompts | [references/orchestration.md](references/orchestration.md) |
| send/receive inter-agent messages (the mailbox) | [docs/c11-mailbox-guide.md](../../docs/c11-mailbox-guide.md) |
| surface-manifest depth, sidebar reporting (`set-status` / `set-progress` / `log`), flash, precedence & sources | [references/metadata.md](references/metadata.md) |
| tail the file-first events stream (`c11 events tail`), envelope schema, v1 taxonomy | [references/events.md](references/events.md) |
| workspace persistence, snapshots, the conversation store & resume | [references/conversation.md](references/conversation.md) |
| the Claude session-resume hook | [references/claude-resume.md](references/claude-resume.md) |
| drive the embedded browser (validate UI without leaving c11) | [c11-browser skill](../c11-browser/SKILL.md) |
| open markdown surfaces with live reload | [c11-markdown skill](../c11-markdown/SKILL.md) |

A few cross-cutting rules worth knowing before you reach for those:

- **`send` / `set-status` / `log` take their text as a trailing positional, not `--text`.** `c11 send --surface <s> "npm test"`. Writing `--text "…"` types the literal string `--text` into the terminal.
- **`send` / `send-key` require explicit targeting.** Pass `--workspace` and `--surface` *together* when the target isn't your own surface; `--window` alone is not enough. An empty or stale ref (`--surface ""`, a dead `surface:99`) is an error, not a quiet fallback to whatever pane is focused.
- **A multi-line `send` arrives whole and becomes one turn**, in a background workspace as reliably as in the focused one. Brief a sibling agent directly; you don't need to stage the text in a file and send a pointer.
- **Socket/CLI commands never steal macOS focus**, and telemetry commands run off-main — don't expect a `send` to raise a window.
- **`send` reaches PTYs only.** It cannot drive AppKit/SwiftUI controls (the text box, settings, sidebar, find overlay). For those, ask the operator or use accessibility automation.

## Editing this skill

It installs as a **one-time copy** under `~/.claude/skills/c11/`; the app does not track the repo source after install. After any source edit, run `scripts/sync-installed-skills.sh c11` or the live copy agents load stays stale. This is the skill-editing equivalent of `reload.sh` after a code change.

## Troubleshooting

If `c11` on PATH isn't the active bundle's CLI, run `c11 doctor` (`--json` for machine-readable). It reports the bundled CLI path, how `c11` resolves on PATH, and a `status` of `ok | mismatch | missing | no_bundle`.
