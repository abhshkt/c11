# Contributing to c11

c11 is built by a small team and a rotating cast of their agents. Outside contributions from humans, from humans-with-agents, and from agents-with-humans-reviewing are all welcome — they read the same way to us. What matters is whether the change is correct, well-shaped, and defensible.

This doc is the practical onramp. Skim the links at the end for depth.

## Before you start

- **Read [PHILOSOPHY.md](PHILOSOPHY.md)** if your change touches product shape or primitives. c11 has strong opinions about staying unopinionated; knowing where those opinions live saves review rounds.
- **Glance at [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md)** for the operational guardrails — testing policy, submodule etiquette, latency-sensitive code paths, socket threading rules. It's written for agents, but it's terse, accurate, and useful to humans too.
- **Check open issues and `TODO.md` / `C11_TODO.md`** before opening a feature PR. Some ideas are intentionally parked.
- **File an issue first for anything non-trivial.** A two-line sketch of the approach is much cheaper than a rejected 800-line PR.

## Prerequisites

- macOS 14+ (Sonoma or later)
- Xcode 15+
- [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) (`brew install zig`) — needed to build the bundled Ghostty as an xcframework
- Git with submodule support (stock git is fine)

## Getting the source

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Stage-11-Agentics/c11.git
cd c11
./scripts/setup.sh
```

`setup.sh` initializes submodules (ghostty, bonsplit, homebrew-c11), builds `GhosttyKit.xcframework`, and lays down symlinks. Run it once; re-run when submodules change.

## The hot-reload loop

Day-to-day builds go through `./scripts/reload.sh`, which builds and launches a Debug app. **Always use `--tag`** — it gives your build its own name, bundle ID, socket, and DerivedData path, so it doesn't fight a co-located instance:

```bash
./scripts/reload.sh --tag my-branch-slug
```

Relevant variants:

| Script | What it does |
|---|---|
| `./scripts/reload.sh --tag <tag>` | Build + launch Debug, isolated (the default you want) |
| `./scripts/reloadp.sh` | Build + launch Release (kills running c11 first) |
| `./scripts/reloads.sh` | Build + launch Release as "c11 STAGING" |
| `./scripts/rebuild.sh` | Clean rebuild |

Full detail and the gotchas live in [`skills/c11-hotload/SKILL.md`](skills/c11-hotload/SKILL.md).

## Running tests

c11 has three test suites. In order of escalation:

1. **Swift unit tests** (`c11Tests/`) — `xcodebuild -scheme c11-unit`, or run from Xcode. No app launch, fast.
2. **Python socket tests** (`tests_v2/`) — attach to a running c11 over its socket. Launch a tagged Debug build first (`./scripts/reload.sh --tag testing`), then point the runner at that build's socket:
   ```bash
   C11_SOCKET=/tmp/c11-debug-testing.sock ./scripts/run-tests-v2.sh
   ```
   Never run these against an untagged build while another c11 is also running — you'll collide on `/tmp/c11.sock`.
3. **E2E / UI tests** (`c11UITests/`) — heavyweight; prefer CI via `gh workflow run test-e2e.yml`. You can run them locally, but they're slow and occasionally flaky on low-RAM machines.

> **Note for agent contributors working inside a live c11 session:** `CLAUDE.md` says "never run tests locally." That rule exists because an agent launching an untagged debug build will hijack the operator's running socket. It does *not* apply to a human running their own tests on their own machine. When in doubt, use `--tag`.

## Opening a pull request

### Commit style

- **New commits, not amends.** If a pre-commit hook fails, fix the issue and push a new commit — don't rewrite history the reviewer may have already pulled.
- Write messages that explain *why*, not *what*. The diff already shows the *what*.
- Sign off as the git author; use `Co-Authored-By` trailers for agents when they did meaningful work on the change. Honest attribution helps us calibrate review depth and normalizes the practice.
- If your PR touches code that clearly came from upstream [cmux](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux), flag it in the description so we can decide whether to also float the fix upstream. See the "cmux ↔ c11 relationship" section in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md).

### The PR template and review bots

Every PR uses [`.github/pull_request_template.md`](.github/pull_request_template.md). The non-obvious parts:

- **Demo video** for UI or behavior changes. A twenty-second screen capture saves five rounds of review.
- **Review-bot trigger block.** After your latest commit, paste the `@codex review` / `@coderabbitai review` / etc. block as a PR comment. Resolve what they surface — or explain why it's wrong — before a human reviews.

### UI changes need a demo

We don't merge UI changes without a video. Prose can't catch typing-latency regressions; a recording can.

### Localization

c11 ships in English plus six translations (ja, uk, ko, zh-Hans, zh-Hant, ru). All strings live in `Resources/Localizable.xcstrings`.

- **Write English only.** Use `String(localized: "key.name", defaultValue: "English text")` at every user-facing call site. Don't hand-author the non-English values in product code.
- **Translations come after.** If your PR adds new English strings, have your agent run the translation pass — delegate it to a sub-agent in a fresh c11 surface to sync `Localizable.xcstrings` across the six locales before merge.

### Code quality guardrails

A few areas carry strict rules. If you're editing near any of these, read the full note in [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md):

- **Typing-latency-sensitive paths** (`WindowTerminalHostView.hitTest()`, `TabItemView`, `TerminalSurface.forceRefresh()`). Extra allocations or main-thread work here is visible as typing lag.
- **Socket command threading.** Telemetry hot paths (`report_*`, status / progress updates) must not hop `DispatchQueue.main.sync`. Default new socket commands to off-main unless you have a concrete reason otherwise.
- **Socket focus policy.** Socket commands don't steal app focus — only explicit focus-intent commands (`window.focus`, `surface.focus`, etc.) may change selection.
- **Test quality.** Tests verify observable runtime behavior. Tests that grep source text, read `Info.plist`, or assert on AST shape get rejected. If a behavior isn't exercisable yet, add a seam first and test through it.

## Working on the ghostty submodule

The `ghostty` submodule points at [`manaflow-ai/ghostty`](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/ghostty) — a fork of upstream Ghostty carrying c11-specific patches.

```bash
cd ghostty
git checkout -b my-ghostty-feature
# make changes
git add .
git commit -m "Description of changes"
git push manaflow my-ghostty-feature
```

Then bump the submodule pointer in the parent repo:

```bash
cd ..
git add ghostty
git commit -m "Bump ghostty submodule"
```

**Always push the submodule commit to `manaflow/main` (or a branch on the fork) before committing the parent pointer.** A detached-HEAD submodule commit is orphaned and lost — verify with `git merge-base --is-ancestor HEAD origin/main` inside `ghostty/` before bumping.

Conflict notes and fork status live in [`docs/ghostty-fork.md`](docs/ghostty-fork.md) and [`docs/upstream-sync.md`](docs/upstream-sync.md).

## Contributing with your agent

c11 is agent-native. We expect a lot of contributions to involve one. If you're bringing an agent, hand it [`docs/contributing-with-your-agent.md`](docs/contributing-with-your-agent.md) before you hand it the keyboard. It covers context files, the PR flow for agent-authored changes, and the footguns we've seen repeat.
