/// Pure Foundation, no app-only imports — compiled into both the app target
/// (the `EventLog` writer builds and serializes envelopes) and the `c11-cli`
/// target (the `c11 events tail` reader uses the field-name constants and the
/// line-parse helpers to filter). `payload` is deliberately an untyped
/// `[String: Any]` so app-only enums (e.g. `MetadataSource`) never leak into
/// this file — the emit site stringifies such values before handing them over.
///
/// Ordering contract: **`seq` is the sequence oracle**, assigned on the writer's
/// serial queue so file order and seq order always agree. `ts` is captured on
/// the emitting thread and is only approximately monotonic — it may invert
/// slightly relative to `seq` across racing threads. Consumers order by `seq`.
