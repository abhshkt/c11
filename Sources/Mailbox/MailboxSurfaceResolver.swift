/// envelope into the recipient's workspace outbox (where that workspace's own
/// dispatcher then delivers it locally, unchanged).

///      pre-cross-workspace behavior exactly — a same-workspace send never
///      reaches into another workspace, even if a same-named surface exists
///      elsewhere.
///   2. Otherwise, among the other workspaces:
///        * exactly one workspace matches  → deliver there;
///        * more than one workspace matches → `.ambiguous` (the caller must
///          disambiguate with a workspace qualifier);
///        * none match → `.unresolved` (the caller surfaces a non-zero error).
///   A `workspaceQualifier` short-circuits the precedence: only surfaces in
///   that workspace are considered, and the result is `.unique` or
///   `.unresolved`.

/// Multiple same-named surfaces inside the chosen workspace are returned
/// together; the dispatcher fans out to all of them, matching how
