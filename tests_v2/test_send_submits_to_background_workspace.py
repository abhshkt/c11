"""C11-173: `c11 send` must actually submit — including into a background workspace.

The defect this pins: `send` typed the payload with synthetic key events and then
submitted with a synthesized `NSEvent` Return. NSEvent synthesis needs a window,
and a pane in a *non-selected* workspace is portal-detached (no window), so the
Return was silently dropped. `send` returned OK, the text sat in the composer,
and a fleet of background agents looked briefed while none had received anything.

Multi-line payloads failed a second way: each embedded newline became a Return
key event, so the payload fragmented into one submission per line.

Run against a live tagged build's socket:
