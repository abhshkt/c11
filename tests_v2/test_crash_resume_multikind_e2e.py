"""C11-164 (RES-1..RES-5): the multi-kind force-kill crash-resume ACCEPTANCE gate.

This is the acceptance oracle for the crash-resume machinery. It drives a TAGGED
c11 build through the full save / kill -9 / relaunch / reclassify loop across
>=12 conversations spanning ALL FOUR first-class agent kinds
(claude-code, codex, pi, omp) in >=4 workspaces, with deliberately adversarial
fixtures, and asserts on the reclassified conversation-store STATE (not on the
resume keystroke — see crash_resume_support module docstring for why).

============================ HOW TO RUN ============================
Author-only; do NOT run inside the orchestration. To run it yourself:

    # 1. Build (and launch) the tagged app ONCE. The harness manages its own
    #    launches thereafter (it needs to inject the PATH shims), and kills the
    #    reload-launched instance first.
    ./scripts/reload.sh --tag res-post

    # 2. Run the acceptance harness (never via the host-bound xcodebuild action):
    python3 tests_v2/test_crash_resume_multikind_e2e.py

    # Optional: run a subset by name substring, e.g.
    python3 tests_v2/test_crash_resume_multikind_e2e.py all_present kill_switch

PREREQUISITES (interactive workstation): this harness drives a REAL tagged c11
GUI, so the macOS screen must be UNLOCKED and (ideally) not asleep — a locked
session restricts the window server and the app can't materialise workspaces, so
every surface reads ready=0. The run aborts up front if it detects a locked
screen. Run under `caffeinate -d -i` to hold the display awake. CI's headless
runner has neither constraint.

Everything is isolated to the `res-post` tagged bundle id / socket / snapshot,
so it never touches the operator's prod c11 (this session) or its sessions.

============================ TOPOLOGY (12 surfaces / 12 workspaces / 4 kinds) ==
  claude-code x4  (cc0..cc3)     push-primary: SessionStart-hook emulation.
  codex       x4  (cx0, cx1,     pull-primary: id resolved from the rollout file
                   cxADVa,cxADVb)  at restore. cx0/cx1 have DISTINCT cwds (each
                                   codex fixture's first-line payload.cwd matches
                                   its surface) so they resume cleanly; cxADVa +
                                   cxADVb SHARE one cwd → the ambiguity policy
                                   fires (two candidates, same cwd → state
                                   unknown "ambiguous").
  pi          x2  (pi0, pi1)     pull-primary, cwd-slug-scoped. pi1's cwd carries
                                   BOTH a STALE (mtime < claim) and a FRESH
                                   (mtime > claim) session file, so the claim-time
                                   floor is exercised: floor drops the stale one →
                                   pi1 resolves cleanly (else it would go
                                   ambiguous).
  omp         x2  (omp0, omp1)   pull-primary, cwd-slug-scoped.

Adversarial coverage (mandatory per the brief):
  * >=1 same-cwd codex pair (cxADVa/cxADVb) — exercises the ambiguity policy.
  * >=1 cwd (pi1) with a stale+fresh pair — exercises the mtime/activity floor.

============================ ORACLE ============================
Per surface, from `c11 conversation list --json` (see
crash_resume_support.classify_conversation):
  RESOLVED          state=suspended + "crash recovery: transcript verified on
                    disk". Resume will fire.
  HONEST_DIAGNOSTIC real ref, unknown/tombstoned, non-empty reason (ambiguous /
                    transcript-not-found). Did NOT resume; said why.
  UNRESOLVED        placeholder survived (scrape kind, no on-disk session) — a
                    SAFE skip (resume() skips placeholders), distinguished from
                    a genuine silent fresh-launch.
  FAIL              state=alive, or suspended WITHOUT the verified reason — the
                    silent fresh/wrong resume this gate exists to catch.

Acceptance passes iff every surface is RESOLVED or HONEST_DIAGNOSTIC (0 FAIL,
0 UNRESOLVED), with the adversarial pair honestly ambiguous.

Scenario variants: all-present (acceptance), one-transcript-missing-per-kind,
clean `app restart`, double kill-9 (idempotent), and the
CMUX_DISABLE_CONVERSATION_STORE kill switch.
