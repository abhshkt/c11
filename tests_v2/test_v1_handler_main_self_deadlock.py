"""C11-26 followup regression: v1 socket handlers must not self-deadlock on main.

Why this test exists
--------------------
After C11-26 (#112), the new socket dispatcher
(`processCommandUsingSocketExecutionPolicy`) routes default-policy commands
through

    DispatchQueue.main.sync { MainActor.assumeIsolated { processCommand(...) } }

from the worker thread. That moves every v1 handler — and every
default-policy v2 handler — onto the main thread before the switch fires.

About 100 v1 handlers in `TerminalController.swift` (and 12 in
`ThemeSocketMethods.swift`) were written against the *pre*-C11-26 reality
where `handleClient` invoked `processCommand(trimmed)` directly on the
worker. Those handlers hop to main themselves with bare
`DispatchQueue.main.sync { … }`. Post-C11-26 that hop is reentrant:
libdispatch's self-deadlock guard (`__DISPATCH_WAIT_FOR_QUEUE__`) traps with
EXC_BREAKPOINT and Apple's UI never surfaces it — the c11 window vanishes.

The operator hit this 4× on 2026-05-04 (twice on a `c11 DEV main` build,
twice on shipped 0.45.0/0.45.1). Every Sentry-native breakpad dump in
`~/.local/state/ghostty/crash/*.ghosttycrash` bottoms out at
`setProgress(_:) + 924` → `closure #1 in processCommand(_:) + 3856` →
`__DISPATCH_WAIT_FOR_QUEUE__ + 484`. The earlier 14:26 IPS hang on 0.44.1
(build 95) is the same class of bug pre-detection: same dispatch path, same
self-wait, but on an older libdispatch that hung indefinitely instead of
trapping.

What this test asserts
----------------------
- Issuing a v1 `set_progress` command across 30 fresh socket connections does
  not crash the c11 process. Pre-fix, the first call would trap and the
  second connect would fail (`ECONNREFUSED`) because the listener was gone.
  Post-fix, every call returns "OK" and the listener stays up.
- A spread of other v1 commands that follow the same bare-`main.sync` shape
  (`set_status`, `clear_status`, `report_pwd`, `clear_progress`,
  `report_git_branch`, `clear_git_branch`) all complete cleanly. They share
  the dispatcher path, so a regression on the dispatcher would fail any of
  them; covering several anchors the fix instead of testing one anchor only.

What this test does NOT do
--------------------------
- It does not grep `Sources/TerminalController.swift` for `v2MainSync` or
  any other implementation token (per c11 CLAUDE.md "Test quality policy" —
  tests verify observable runtime behavior, not implementation shape).
- It does not assert on Sentry/breakpad files directly. Whether a regression
  produces a crash dump or just a hang depends on macOS/libdispatch version;
  the contract this test enforces is "the call returns OK and the next
  connection succeeds", which catches both shapes.

How to run
----------
This test runs against a tagged debug build of c11. Per c11 CLAUDE.md
"Testing policy", do NOT `open` an untagged `c11 DEV.app` to run it — use the
tagged build socket produced by `./scripts/reload.sh --tag <slug>`.
